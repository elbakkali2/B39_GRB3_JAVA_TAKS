    NOTE TO SELF:

    Defining the argument as Number allows the method to accept any numeric wrapper class in Java, such as Integer, Long, Double, Float, and Short,
    instead of being limited to just one type like int. All these classes are subclasses of the abstract class Number,
    which provides methods to convert their values to different primitive types (e.g., intValue(), longValue(), doubleValue()).
    Using Number as the parameter type makes the method more flexible and reusable, as it can handle different numeric types without
    needing separate overloads for each one. For example, we can pass an Integer, Double, or Long to the same method, and it will work with all of them.
    This is not possible with primitive types like int, because primitives are not objects and do not inherit from Number.
    Defining the argument as Number enables the method to accept a broader range of numeric input types,
    increasing its versatility and compatibility with Javaâ€™s numeric wrapper classes.

    EXPLANATION FOR int digit = (int) (value % 10);

        Since value is of type long, computing the remainder by "value % 10" (value is divided by 10) results in a long type.
        (int) (value % 10) explicitly casts the result from long to int.
        The cast is necessary because digit is declared as an int, and Java does not automatically convert a long to an int without an explicit cast.

    EXPLANATION FOR reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;

        1)Multiplying reversed by 10 shifts all its digits left
        2)Adding digit appends the new digit to the rightmost position.

        reversed * 10 shifts the current number left by one digit.
        + digit adds the new digit at the end.
        Repeating this for each digit reconstructs the original number in reverse order.

        Example:

            Suppose you are reversing the number 123:

            Start:

                reversed = 0
                digit = 3 (last digit of 123)

            First Iteration:

                reversed = 0 * 10 + 3 = 3

            Second Iteration:

                digit = 2 (next digit from right)
                reversed = 3 * 10 + 2 = 32

            Third Iteration:

                digit = 1 (next digit from right)
                reversed = 32 * 10 + 1 = 321

    EXPLANATION FOR value /= 10; -> uses "integer division" to remove the last digit from the number

        Variable "long value" stores whole numbers (no decimals) -> In Java, both int and long are integer types (as opposed to floating-point types like float and double).
        Dividing an integer by 10 shifts all digits to the right by one place, effectively dropping the last digit.
        This happens because "integer division" in Java discards any fractional part -> For example, if value is 123, then 123 / 10 yields 12 -not 12.3- because Java's integer division always truncates (discards) the fractional part of the result

        value /= 10; removes the last digit from the variable value by shifting all digits right and discarding the remainder.
        This is a common technique for digit-by-digit processing of numbers in programming.
