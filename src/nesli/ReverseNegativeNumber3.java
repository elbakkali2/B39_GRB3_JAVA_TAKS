    NOTE TO SELF:

    The recursive reversal process works as follows:

        Extract the Last Digit:

            In each recursive call, the function gets the last digit of the number using the modulus operator (number % 10).

        Build the Reversed Number:

            The helper function maintains an accumulator (result) that represents the reversed number built so far.
            At each step, the last digit is added to the accumulator after shifting its digits left by multiplying by 10 (result * 10 + number % 10).

        Recursive Call:

            The function then removes the last digit from the number using integer division (number / 10) and calls itself recursively with the remaining number and the updated accumulator.

        Base Case:

            When the number becomes 0, the recursion stops, and the accumulator contains the fully reversed number, which is then returned.
